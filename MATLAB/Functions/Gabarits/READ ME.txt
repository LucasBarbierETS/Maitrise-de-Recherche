'Gabarits' function are functions that return a profile of absorption coefficient. They are used in optimisation processes
to reach an desired curve for an acoustic structure.

As input arguments, they take : 
	- w : a frequency (rad/s) support vector that is the reference

	- f : the importants frequency (Hz) of the profil 
     (f_peak for narrow passband, [f-3dB_min  f-3dB_min] for large passband, f-3dB for lowpass or high pass, etc.)

	- Q : the quality factor to describe how smooth the profil is

	- alpha : the value of the absorption coefficient on the peak/ passband of the profile

You can add together several differents gabarits in a 'classgabarit' object.
